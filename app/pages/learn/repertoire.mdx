# karpatkey Repertoire

The karpatkey repertoire is a collection of permissions tailored to the specific [non-custodial treasury management practices at karpatkey](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure).

<Callout type="info">
  While DeFi Kit is designed for general purpose use, actions from the
  repertoire are primarily intended for internal use by karpatkey. As such APIs
  are subject to change without notice.
</Callout>

Just like general DeFi Kit actions, repertoire actions are grouped by protocol.
However, there is no standardization of repertoire actions across protocols.
Instead there may be numerous variations of the same action, each tailored to a specific execution or contingency strategy.

While DeFi Kit provides the role-based permission sets for repertoire actions, the actual execution of these actions is automated through functions in [DeFi Repertoire](https://github.com/karpatkey/defi-repertoire), a karpatkey internal, closed source project.
